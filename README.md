# Physics Engine - Orbital Mechanics Branch

After experimenting and learning about basic physics simulations, I've taken out this branch to focus on simulating Orbital Mechanics, something I find very interesting. The goal here is not only to create a simulation engine for orbital mechanics but also to gain a deeper understanding of how more complex engines work under the hood. Along the way, I also look forward to learning more about orbital mechanics in general. 

This branch continues to build on the original physics engine while introducing new features to simulate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, and orbital motion. It's a step forward in expanding the engine's capabilities, allowing for more advanced physics simulations.
