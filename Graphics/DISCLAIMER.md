## Disclaimer

I apologize for the state of the code in this directory. Originally, I intended to create a graphics library for the Physics Engine, but it quickly devolved into a poorly planned and poorly written SFML wrapper. 

Its only purpose now is to offer a simple, albeit inefficient, way of displaying graphics on the screen. This doesn't belong in this project and should ideally be a separate project. 

However, for now, it gets the job done, so I'm keeping it here until I find time to fix it.
